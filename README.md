# InvariantsSanitizer

## Introduction

[Daikon](http://plse.cs.washington.edu/daikon/), an implementation of dynamic detection of likely invariants, provides [Kvasir](https://plse.cs.washington.edu/daikon/download/doc/daikon.html#Kvasir) as the front end for C and C++. And *Kvasir* uses [Valgrind](https://valgrind.org/) which is a framework for heavyweight DBI as its infrastructure. 

Years have been passed and nowadays people prefer to use [sanitizers](https://github.com/google/sanitizers) as an alternative to *Valgrind*. So perhaps it's the right time to try detecting invariants with state-of-the-art ï»¿techniques from [AddressSanitizer](https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizer)/[MemorySanitizer](https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/MemorySanitizer) now. Besides, [Daikon Developer Manual - 2.7.2 Instrumenting C programs](https://plse.cs.washington.edu/daikon/download/doc/developer.pdf) also holds a positive attitude towards this:

> You may wish to infer invariants over C programs running on other platforms; for instance, you
want a robust C front end that works under Microsoft Windows. This section will help you to
either write such a front end or to hand-instrument your program to produce output that Daikon
can process.

> We welcome additions and corrections to this part of the manual. And, if you write a C instrumenter
that might be of use to others, please contribute it back to the Daikon project.

> The problem of tracking C memory may seem daunting, but it is not insurmountable. There
exist many tools for detecting or debugging memory errors in C, and they need to perform exactly
the same memory tracking as a Daikon front end must perform. Therefore, a Daikon front end
can use the same well-known techniques, and possibly can even be built on top of such a tool.

> There are two basic approaches to instrumenting a C program (or a program in any other
language): instrument the source code, or instrument a compiled binary representation of the
program.

And I'm glad to have a try :)
